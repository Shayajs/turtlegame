"-Hey, you're new to the neighborhood? 
-Not really... Who are you?
-We're the twins mushrooms. Sorry for the rudeness, we don't bump into a human and a turtle hanging out together everyday. We never bump into a human at all actually.
-Really? Haven't you met any human recently around here?
-No, we've been living here for a while and we didn't see a single one.But if you look for information, most of people live in the forest now. 
-And turtles too?
-Yeah, turtles are quite unusual but yeah, probably there too."
