The neighborhood around has nothing to do with what we used to know. In only two months,   the tar of the road turned purple. The external walls of all the houses are covered with snow, not sure about how it’s holding up.There are no cars, no sign of recent human occupation. Most of the poles are destroyed, melted into the ground, there’s still a poster on one of them. The way to the forest seems highlighted as if someone wanted us to go. And 2 human-sized mushrooms were “facing” us.
