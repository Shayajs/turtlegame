"-What do you want?
-You've stolen a baby hedgehog, his family wants him back
-And so? Then send you as a messenger? You can go away now.
-You're such a dork
-You don't know me, don't insult me
-No need to know someone who stole a baby to conclude they're a jerk.
-Okay, kid, you think you know everything? Let's make a deal, if you answer correctly three questions of mine, I'll let you leave with the hedgehog.
-Deal
-Let me know when you're ready."
(You have to "attack" with good answer the monkey)
