"-Hi, I'm DinoLou. You seem a little bit young to take a walk here. What do you do around here?
-We don't know what to do, we've lost our Babou 2 months ago, during the turf war. Our research went infructuous and we had no idea why the world is like that now.
-I'm sorry kids... I haven't seen any humans for a long time, maybe if you tell me exactly what happened maybe we can do something.
Kiddo gathered all the forces of the world to explain the next part:
-Babou always talked a lot about how we would be ready when the world would be collapsing  because of a lot of things I didn't quite understand. 
One day, loud gunshots woke me up, Babou burst in my room saying it was time to go into the bunker. I was so scared I've gathered my things and went to the place without questionning a thing.
But once inside our new home, I've asked where was turtle. Babou went looking inside the house and he never came back. It turns out to be that turtle was sleeping inside my backpack all along.
I don't think we will find Babou, if everything was okay, the way to bunker is pretty easy to remember."
After a brief silence, the diplodocus speaks again.
"-I'm sorry kids. You know, I also lost a family member, but mine isn't really lost. I know where he's being held but I can't get him back. If you help me, it will prove me you're safe to be a part of our community and i will indicate you the way to our secret village. You would be able to rest here and settle as long as you want.
-Yeah, why not. What can we do for you?
-An old monkey stole Hoglet, our baby hedgehog. I don't know why this rascal took our baby away but I've already talked to him and no matter wanted i've proposed was enough for this monster to give him back to us.
The monkey lives inside an former bank across the street. You need to go back from you went to find it.
-We got you DinoLou!"
