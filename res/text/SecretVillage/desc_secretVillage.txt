There is a charming village crowded with animals and plants of all kinds.The houses were made of woods, rocks. Some habitations were built on the ground, some up the trees, some in the water of a river crossing the place, some were dug out the ground. Everything seems marvelous, including the little butterfly flying everywhere around us.
